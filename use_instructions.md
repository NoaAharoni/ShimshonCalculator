Run the Python (server) file (I recommend to open this on pycharm), then run the react (client) files. to run the react open it on vs code, open the terminal of the project and do cd to client, after that write the command "npm start" and it should open it on the web.
if you want to visit the page from another browser go to http://localhost/3000.
